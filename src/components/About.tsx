				<p>My journey into coding </p>
			</div>
			<br />
			<p>
				My coding journey started as a kid writing small batch files in
				QBasic to automate the process of backing files up to floppy
				disks - useful as I liked taking apart the family computer to
				figure out how it worked. I broke that computer. A lot.
			</p>
			<br />
			<p>
				I then spent a few years training as a chemical engineer writing
				code to size reactors, then a few more years running a business,
				where I created more small scripts to automate some of my day to
				day tasks. I then decided that rather than build a bunch of
				small scripts I should try and learn how to make fully fledged
				websites and apps.
			</p>
			<br />
			<p>
				Fast forward to today and I am now a full stack developer that
				gets to combine my love for coding with my love of building
				things.
			</p>
